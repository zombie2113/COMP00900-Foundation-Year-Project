<h2>About the University of Manchester</h2>
<p class = "p">A useful website during the collaboration of this information has been the <a
href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/">Manchester
Heritage History</a> site. 
<br>
<h3>History of the University</h3>

<p class = "p">To begin with the University of Manchester was first established in the 1800s where it was
granted a Royal Charter in becoming England's first civic university it was renamed the
Victoria University of Manchester in 1903. But the current University of Manchester was
created on the 22 nd of October 2004 by the amalgamation of the Victoria University of
Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).
This was decided by both institutes after working closely together for approximately one
hundred years, creating the largest single-site university in the UK. (It has the second
highest number of students enrolled, the open university is the first.)</p>

<br>

<h3>Victoria University of Manchester</h3>

<p class = "p">The Victoria University of Manchester was first developed out of the Owens College which
was founded in the year 1851, where it further expanded from 1872 where a medical school
(owned by doctors) known as the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, was incorporated
into Victoria UoM. Moreover, Owens college was created by Johns Owens in 1845 (where
construction first began) which was part of his legacy, which was to open a college for
education and being done so on non-sectarian lines <br>
From the 1860s a new vision came about from the college, the leading professors looked
to the German Universities for inspiration. This is where they learned that the key for
progression is to invest more time and money into research as it advances the knowledge of
mankind and has many major benefits.</p>

<br>

<h3>UMIST</h3>
<p class = "p">UMIST (which stands for The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology)
was founded in 1824 as part of a movement which aimed to forward the education of
working men in this era. This idea was put forward because very few people had basic
education; mainly because primary schooling education was not yet compulsory, this
however changed on 1870. <br><br>
In addition to this UMIST was growing in a rapid way and needed a new building too keep
up with the added number of students and this thus in 1853 a new building was opened on
Princess Street. At the time Britain was facing fierce competition for the top spot in being an
industrial nation, this then lead ex-shoemaker, John Henry Reynolds to run a programme of
classes which primarily focused on the industrial needs of Manchester. In 1883 he then
decided to convert the Mechanics&#39; Institute into the Manchester Technical School. Finally,
from the year 1892 the Technical school became officially funded by the Manchester
Corporation, and the school now became Municipal Technical School.</p>

<br>

<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p class = "p">There are many notable buildings at the University, including the Sackville
Street Building, which was was opened by the Municipal Technical School in 1902, but
after the first world war the school was renamed to the Manchester Municipal College of
Technology.<br><br>
The Samuel Alexander building, named after Samuel Alexander, Professor of Philosophy (1859-1925). The
building currently houses most of the School of Arts, languages and cultures theology.
Samuel Alexander was a philosopher, originally from Melbourne Australia who then moved
to Oxford to study philosophy. But, then became a professor of philosophy in Manchester
from 1893 until his death. The reason why he was so important was due to the fact he
supported women's rights and advocated for their education

<h3>Nobel Prize Winners</h3>
<p class = "p">The University of Manchester has 25 Nobel laureates to its name, including former staff and
students. Some of these prize winners include the likes of Ernest Rutherford who was
awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1908) for discovering the atomic structure. He
essentially fired alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold, however roughly 1 in 8000 particles
deflected backwards, leading too the conclusion the atom has a small area with a
concentrated piece of mass (which we now know as the nucleus.)
James Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (1935) shortly after Rutherford\u2019s
discovery, but Chadwick did not discover the atomic structure, he instead discovered the
existence of neutrons. (Chadwick and Rutherford used to work together). A more recent
example of a novel prize winner is for physics in 2010 by Konstantin Novoselov. He
essentially discovered the properties of graphene by playing around in a lab
session.</p>

<h3>Courses at the University</h3>
<p class = "p">
Currently the University of Manchester offers hundreds of courses ranging from Accounting
all the way too zoology, most degree programmes offer an opportunity to achieve a masters,
or PHD and a few offering a year in industry or a placement year. The University also offers
the chance for students to continue with some research even after graduating at the
university. But one major thing that differentiates the University of Manchester from many
other Universities is that it has such a diverse range of students. In fact students from about
160 countries are currently enrolled here.

<h2>About the School of Computer Science</h2>
<p class = "p">
Most of the information about the School of Computer Science can be found on
their <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">website.</a>
<p class = "p">To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the School of Computer Science in 2014,
several statistics were compiled to showcase the <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/">achievements
of the school.</a></p>


<br><br>
<h3>The School of Computer Science</h3>

<p class = "p">Our group are all aspiring to become part of the School of Computer Science
at the University of Manchester. A part of our studies on the Foundation Year
includes completing this group project website, acting as members of the School
and attending labs within the main building for the department, called the
Kilburn building, named after one of the founding fathers of the School.</p>

<br>

<h3>The History of the School of Computer Science</h3>

<p class = "p">The School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester is one of the
oldest Computer Science schools in the UK. Across the years, it has had 9 Heads
of School and collectively the department has most certainly contributed greatly
to the development of Computer Science. To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the
School of Computer Science in 2014, several statistics were compiled to showcase
the achievements of the school.</p>


<p class = "p">Despite the School being founded in 1964, Computer Science was first
introduced to the University of Manchester in 1946 when Tom Kilburn and Frederic
Calland Williams started developing the cathode ray tube which later became the
first Random Access Memory device. Throughout 1967, Kilburn and Williams worked
together on the 'Baby', the world's first device considered to be a computer.
Various computers were developed then, with the assistance of Dr Alan Turing who
had joined the Department of Mathematics in October 1948. Throughout the
following years, various faster computers and high-level computer languages were
developed by the team, incluhttp://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/staff/ding the <a
href="http://elearn.cs.man.ac.uk/~atlas/">Ferranti Atlas.</a></p>

<img src="Atlas.jpg" alt="The Atlas" align="middle" width="427.5" height="281.5" class = "img" class = "img">
<br>

<p class = "p">The focus of the School was on engineering, software and mathematics. It grew
in popularity, opening its £1.7M purpose-build building, the Kilburn building,
in 1972. Since then the department  has grown and grown, being involved in many
projects including Amulet 1, based around developing commercial microprocessors,
and MAVERIK, one of the first VR systems and text mining. Nowadays, the
department is researching a number of <a
href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/groups/">projects.</a></p>


<h3>Learning at the School of Computer Science</h3>

<p class = "p">Students taking a degree in the School of Computer Science aren't necessarily taking a Computer Science degree, there are a few different pathways for students to take. Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Taught Master's positions are available at the School.
