		Markup and Scripting Languages

	<h2> About Markup Languages</h2>
	
	<p class = "p">
	Markup languages are standard text encoding systems compromising of a range of symbols 
	inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship 
	among its parts. Markup languages were first developed by IBM researchers 
	Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher and Raymond Lorie, who initially created GML, a formatting 
	language used to publish documents in 1969. GML allowed text editing and enabled 
	information-retrieval subsystems to share documents. The language soon gained 
	substantial industry accreditation, with IBM adopting the language and still producing over 90% 
	of its documents using GML till this day.
	</p>
<br>
	<p class = "p">
	Since then, markup languages have been widely used for a number of services including managing 
	molecular information in the chemical field through the language CML (Chemical Markup Language); 
	they are also widely renowned in the business and financial industries whereby markup languages 
	can be used to record electronic trading and processing financial derivatives, however within 
	this project we will be focusing specifically upon web development, using HTML, Hypertext Markup Language.
	</p>
<br>
	<p class = "p">
	HTML is a dialect of GML and is known as the backbone of the internet. The language describes the structure 
	of webpages and contains elements written in tags, as seen in image 1. In this project, HTML 
	will be a significant markup language to help design and construct our website, proving to be a vital skill 
	during this experience. For more information on HTML and any other language used to build this project, 
	please visit the <a href = "Technologies Used for the Website.html"> Technologies used</a> webpage.
	</p>
<br>	
	
	<h2> About Scripting Languages</h2>
	
	<p class = "p">
	Scripting languages are languages intended to solve relatively small programming 
	problems which do not require other features, such as overhead data declarations, required to make large 
	programs manageable. Scripting languages first originated in systems which were used to join programs or 
	tasks together. Many operating systems in the 1980's, such as Unix, used scripting languages to produce 
	powerful tools with efficiency and soon the concept was used to describe inputs to programs which were 
	interpreted to produce a result. Therefore, the central function of scripting is to automate tasks which 
	will otherwise not require complex computational calculations.
	</p>
<br>	
	<p class = "p">
	Throughout this computer science project, we learned Bash scripting, a language developed by Brian 
	Fox for a GNU project, which is a free software project aimed to provide computer users with open source 
	software. Bash was initially released in 1989 and is used as a default login shell for Mac and Linux operating 
	systems. The language is commonly used as a command processor where a user can execute commands, and alongside 
	this, the language can also run commands from a document called a shell script. 
	</p>
<br>	
	<p class = "p">
	Bash scripting is equally important to this project as, at times, it can be used for greater efficiency when 
	executing commands to develop certain features in our website, such as the function of a button, rather than a 
	markup language like HTML. Furthermore, greater depth of knowledge in this language will also help us understand 
	the Linux operating system and the importance of open source software in general software development, thus 
	displaying prominent status of Linux in a computer scientists toolkit.
