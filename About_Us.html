	Ali Awan

<br>
	<p class = "p">
	I am Ali Awan, a Pakistani International student studying Computer Science at the University of Manchester. 
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	The earliest indication of my passion towards computer science began at the age of 14, whereby I was introduced to markup languages in IT 
	class, learning HTML and CSS to explore web development. As a result, this skill supported me when I volunteered to develop a website for 
	my school Community and Service committee; an activity that provided me with the basis of language programming from a more practical viewpoint.
	Alongside this, I assisted my mother's small-scale business in the sales of Pakistani Art and paintings through designing another website, 
	specifically grounded in terms of her requirements, as well as extending general technological support.  These initiatives encouraged me to 
	advance my understanding of the subject, whereby I decided to take part in an online, self-taught CS course, introducing the subject alongside 
	JavaScript programming, and a 4-day rigorous Python course provided by Google. All of these experiences ended up bringing me to the University 
	of Manchester, whereby I’ll be looking forward to studying and exploring my areas of interest in the field and developing upon these raw skills.
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	Outside of CS I am quite passionate about sports, centrally Cricket, although I also play tennis, squash and golf. I recently joined the UOM cricket 
	team and played a tape ball tournament hosted by the Lancashire cricket club. I have played golf at the Abu Dhabi golf club and thoroughly enjoy the 
	game alongside any racket or bat related sport. 
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	Furthermore, during my spare time I occasionally enjoy producing and editing small-scale videos mostly for pure enjoyment with friends, yet also help 
	advertise my mothers paintings business through creating short video clips posted on YouTube and Instagram promoting Pakistani Art. As a result, I also 
	enjoy watching movies and TV shows, and usually critique these mediums in order to learn more about small-scale film filmography and improve on this hobby 
	I have recently discovered.

	Hello! Thanks for visiting our website. I am a Foundation Year Science student hoping to enter the School of Computer Science next year 
	at the University of Manchester. Most of my time is dedicated to University work, either attending lectures and tutorials or catching up 
	with them! However, I live a very busy life with two interesting and demanding hobbies.
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	One of my hobbies is Eventing. Its a very demanding sport involving a horse and rider, competing in three different disciplines: dressage, show 
	jumping and cross country. It’s essentially the equestrian edition of a triathlon. I compete affiliated with British Eventing at BE100 level, although 
	I will be moving up this year to Novice and working towards the lowest level of International Competition by the end of the year. It’s my dream to ride 
	at the level of the GB Under 21 teams, although there’ll be a lot of work to put in to qualify for the teams. For the coming season I have 3 rides. I 
	train at least 5 days a week, riding for around 2 hours each session. My Mum is a huge help when it comes to looking after the horses on a day to day 
	basis when I’m at University, I still live at home and commute to University for the sake of the sport.
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	In January I launched my first single under my own record label as the artist ‘Aelibella’. I’m a musician who mostly plays the guitar and sings. I absolutely adore a range of genres however I enjoy 		playing Rock and Acoustic the most. Music has always been an important part of my life but my passion for singing took off when I started my YouTube channel.
	More recently I started performing again and I absolutely love it! Currently I’m singing and playing 2 sets a week. I perform at Open Mic nights for the most part, although I’ve also sang a few sets 		closer to 30 minutes and on occasion with other musicians. I will be launching my EP (currently named “Gnarled”) in April 2019, in anticipation of my first album which will be released this summer.
	</p>	
	<p class = "p">
	I run social media pages for Eventing on Facebook<a href = "https://www.facebook.com/IsabellaShawEventing/" style = "color: yellow;">(https://www.facebook.com/IsabellaShawEventing/)</a>, 
	Instagram <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/isabellashaweventing/" style = "color: yellow;">(https://www.instagram.com/isabellashaweventing/)</a> and YouTube <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gJy-5lkhmyINdTrWd1bJw" style = "color: yellow;">(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gJy-5lkhmyINdTrWd1bJw)</a>.
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	There are also Facebook <a href = "www.facebook.com/Aelibella" style = "color: yellow;">(www.facebook.com/Aelibella)</a>, Instagram <a href = "www.instagram.com/aelibella" style = "color: yellow;">(www.instagram.com/aelibella)</a> and YouTube 		<a href = "www.youtube.com/user/IssieAndLife" style = "color: yellow;">(www.youtube.com/user/IssieAndLife)</a> pages for Aelibella. 
	If I’m not working on one of my hobbies then you can catch me gaming (I’m a huge PC fan), eating, socialising, cycling, walking, deliberating theoretical physics theories, 
	binge watching TV series and/or movies, experimenting with makeup or droning on about my lack of sleep. Can’t quite understand the reasoning behind the latter.
	Sweet.

	<p class = "p">
	My hobbies include football and gaming. I am a lazy person who cant even bother to cook for myself. Unless my friends call me out, 
	I won't walk out of my room. I like to play Fifa, BFV, league and any competitive PVP stuff. I support Juventus (not because of Ronaldo), 
	I hope we win the UCL this year. I like to make friends but do not maintain fake friends. I like to know everything by a little bit such as sports. 
	I like japan, I like cool looking shoes and I like hot wings.

	<p class = "p">
	My hobbies include going to gym, as well as playing sports such as football and cricket. I also played for my former 
	college sports teams and enjoyed every moment of it. Other than taking part in physical activities I like watching 
	new movies and TV shows, currently I am rewatching Game of Thrones in preparation for the next season which will resume 
	later this year. Moreover, another interest of mine is gaming, however the game I currently play the most has to be Fifa 19. 
	I really enjoy the Fifa series and have bought the latest edition every year, (from 2007 or so). 
	</p>
	<p class = "p">
	In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, family as well as listening to music. In addition to this I also spend 
	my free time watching tv shows and movies.  I also enjoy travelling and I have visited several different countries, but would 
	definitely enjoy seeing even more countries, and explore the different cultures and lifestyles of other countries. I feel this 
	brings a different insight into one's life and allows us to appreciate some of the things we may take for granted also.
